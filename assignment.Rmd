## Summary

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Preprocessing

```{r housekeeping, echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(lattice)
library(caret)

draw     <- read.csv("../pml-training.csv")
testing  <- read.csv("../pml-testing.csv")

# removing row number (X) and timestamps (not doing time series analyses here)
rc <- c("X","user_name", "raw_timestamp_part_1", "raw_timestamp_part_2", "cvtd_timestamp")
rc1 <- which(colnames(training) %in% rc)
dclean <- draw[,-rc1]

# removing features with near zero variance
rc2 <- nearZeroVar(dclean)
dclean <- dclean[,-rc2]

# removing features with mostly (95%) NA (not addressed by nearZeroVar)
rc3 <- which(colSums(is.na(dclean)) / nrow(dclean) > 0.95)
dclean <- dclean[,-rc3]

set.seed(12345)
intrain <- createDataPartition(dclean$classe, p = .70, list = FALSE)
dtrain <- dclean[intrain, ]
dtest  <- dclean[-intrain, ]
```

## Analyses

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r RandomForest, echo=TRUE}
param <- trainControl(method="cv", 5)
mod <- train(classe ~ ., data=dtrain, method="rf", trControl=param, ntree=200)
pred <- predict(mod, dtest)
confusionMatrix(dtest$classe, pred)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
predict(mod, testing)
```
